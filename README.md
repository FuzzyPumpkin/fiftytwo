# fiftytwo/52
A year-long project of projects. 
The recent publications of challenges like #100daysofcode have inspired many developers to create their own versions. Coding a little for 100 days isn't anything new for me; with few exceptions, I code every day in my spare time as I have been focused on learning web development and, now that I'm searching for a job, keeping those skills fresh. What I need, during this fluid time, is structure.

Repetition builds expertise. So why not focus on one project exclusively for a week, then move on? Repeat some of those same features and tricks. Expand into new technologies or new methodologies. Then repeat. fiftytwo/52 is an attempt to learn and refine through repetition and exploration.
